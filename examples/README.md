## Example scripts for testing submission to NSG Portal

### NEURON (hoc format)

There is an example [in the directory ParallelNetwork](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/NSGPortalShowcase/tree/master/examples/NEURON/ParallelNetwork) which represents a network of 500 cells in NEURON which was generated by [neuroConstruct](http://neuroconstruct.org/) which is set up to run on Parallel NEURON.

You can get a local copy of these files with:

    git clone https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/NSGPortalShowcase.git
    cd NSGPortalShowcase/examples/NEURON/ParallelNetwork
    
You should be able to run this locally if NEURON is set up & configured to allow simulations in Parallel:

    nrnivmodl
    mpirun -np 4 nrniv -mpi init.hoc
    
The exact for of the above command will depend on the versionof MPI installed. 

To run it on NSG, either use the [pre built zip file](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/NSGPortalShowcase/blob/master/examples/NEURON/input.zip), or edit the hoc/mod and rebuild the zip file:

    ./makezips.sh
    
and submit this to NSG. [Log in (after having signed up...)](http://www.nsgportal.org/portal2/login!input.action) and ...
