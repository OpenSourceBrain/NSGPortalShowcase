	Client library for the CIPRES REST API.   
	The class CiClient is the starting point.
	<p>
	org.ngbw.directclient.example.Example.java is an example of an
	application that uses this client library.   Looking at its
	source code is probably the easiest way to understand how to use
	this package.
	<p>
	The example is a command line application that repeatedly prompts the user
	to choose to submit a "canned" job, list all the user's jobs,
	get information about a specific job, delete a job, or download
	results.
